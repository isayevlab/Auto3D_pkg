Introduction
============

**Auto3D** is a Python package for generating low-energy conformers from
SMILES/SDF. It automatizes the stereoisomer enumeration and duplicate
filtering process, 3D building process, fast geometry optimization and
ranking process using ANI and AIMNet neural network atomistic
potentials. Auto3D can be imported as a Python library, or be excuted
from the terminal.
